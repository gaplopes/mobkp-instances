# mobkp-instances

## Introduction

This repository contains instances with respective complete non-dominated set (Pareto front) for the Multi-Objective Binary Knapsack Problem (MOBKP).
Moreover, it contains a library to generate new instances for the MOBKP.

The MOBKP is a multi-objective optimization problem where the goal is to maximize multiple objectives subject to a set of constraints.
The MOBKP is defined as follows:

```
maximize f(x) = (f_1(x), f_2(x), ..., f_m(x))
subject to
  sum_{j=1}^{n} w_{j} x_{j} <= c
  x_{j} in {0, 1} for j = 1, ..., n
```

where:
- `n` is the number of items.
- `m` is the number of objectives.
- `w_{j}` is the weight of item `j`.
- `c` is the capacity of the knapsack.
- `x_{j}` is a binary variable that indicates if item `j` is selected.
- `f_i(x)` is the value of the `i-th` objective function for the solution `x`.

The MOBKP is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem with applications in several areas, such as finance, engineering, and logistics.

## Dependencies

This library depends on:

- [mobkp](https://github.com/adbjesus/mobkp) for multi-objective optimization utilities, such as quality indicators and solution sets.
- [mooutils](https://github.com/adbjesus/mooutils) for multi-objective optimization utilities, such as quality indicators and solution sets.
- [apm](https://github.com/adbjesus/apm) for a theoretical anytime performance model that guides one of the algorithms.
- [glpk](https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/)
- [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt)
- [Boost](https://www.boost.org/)

## Installation

To generate new instances using this library you can clone the repository and use cmake to build the project.
For that, you can run the following commands:

```bash
git clone
cd mobkp-instances
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

## Usage

The `mobkp-instances` executable allows you to generate new instances for the MOBKP.

The following options are available:

- `--type`: The type of instance to generate. The following types are available:
  - `0`: Random instances.
  - `1`: Negative correlated objectives instances.
  - `2`: Positive correlated objectives instances.

- `--seed`: The seed to use for the random number generator.

- `--n`: The number of items in the instance.

- `--m`: The number of objectives in the instance.

- `--correlation`: The correlation between the objectives. The following values are available:
  - If `--type=1`, then the correlation is the negative correlation factor and the value should be between 0 and -1.
  - If `--type=2`, then the correlation is the positive correlation factor and the value should be between 0 and 1.

- `--timeout`: The maximum time to generate the instance.

- `--weight-factor`: The factor to multiply the total sum of weights of the items.

- `--outfile`: The file to save the instance.

- `--folder-path`: The folder to save the instance.

Example for different types of instances:

```bash
./mobkp-instances --type=0 --n=20 --m=3 --seed=1 --timeout=10 --weight-factor=0.5 # Random instance
./mobkp-instances --type=1 --n=20 --m=3 --seed=1 --correlation=-0.45 --timeout=10 --weight-factor=0.5 # Negative correlated instance
./mobkp-instances --type=2 --n=20 --m=3 --seed=1 --correlation=0.45 --timeout=10 --weight-factor=0.5 # Positive correlated instance
```

## Instances

The instances are stored in the `instances/` directory. A more detailed description of the instances is provided in the `instances/README.md` file.

## Scripts

The `scripts/` directory contains example scripts to generate instances.
